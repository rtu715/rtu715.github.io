			<h3> More about me... </h3>
			<br>
			<p> I was born in 1998 and lived in Beijing for 14 years. I went to the Experimental High School attached to BNU until travelling to Massachusetts in 2013 for Deerfield Academy. After spending 4 years there, I graduated in 2016 to attend Columbia University as a prospective CS major. </p>
